# 2023-elections-scraping-from-Twitter
In this project, I scraped twitter's API to get tweets that contained the 2023 elections in Nigeria. Presently I have scraped about 1000 tweets and I am working on scraping more. 
On each tweet, I got the username, display name, postdate, no of likes, comments, retweets, reach.
Three major candidates in the presidential elections were Bola Ahmed Tinubu, Peter Obi, Atiku Abubakar. What I want to do is:
1. Actually see the percentage of the tweets about the 2023 elections were about each of the candidates 
2. To have an idea of the popularity of each candidate. 
3. Also, to analyze each of the tweets of each candidate
4. Perform sentiment analysis of the tweets
5. Calculate the impression to reach ratio of each candidate during the election period to know how many percent of reach was converted to interactions.
